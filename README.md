# 100 Days of Code (2022)

## Purpose
This repository will consist of daily work in the form of multiple projects of varying size uploaded to a Github repo. Documentation will be included for each day's worth of work totaling time and work completed. The goal of this program is to improve my skills in several areas of software engineering included but not limited to: programming languages, DevOps, computer science understanding, external integration practices, and more. Over the next 100 Days I plan to showcase my markedly improving software engineering skills to help land myself an opportunity to make this type of work a career. Along with the other development work I already do, this will show employers why I can be a business asset and help them and their business achieve desired success and goals.
